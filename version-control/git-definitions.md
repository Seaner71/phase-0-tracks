# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  version control allows you to view entrie history of revisions to files, and merge revisions made by others. Why is it useful? It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously or the same person can try different versions of the same project. version control allows you to roll back to previous versions
* What is a branch and why would you use one? a branch is a separate version of a file that can be modified and merged back into the master file or become its own. A branch allows different developers to make changes without impacting the master
* What is a commit? A commit is a save point in Git. What makes a good commit message?  A short specific message that details changes made in context. 
* What is a merge conflict? Occurs when your master branch and the branch you want to commit have diverged. It occurs when there are commits in the master not in branch or vice versa.
